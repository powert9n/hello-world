# hello-world

People of Earth, your attention, please. 

This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council. As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for
development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star
system. And regrettably, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than 
two of your Earth minutes. 

Thank you.
